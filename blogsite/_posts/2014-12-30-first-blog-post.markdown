After fighting with ghost, node, and a handful of repositories I finally got the blog up and running. Feels good to have a platform to practice writing again as well. Managed to wrangle the css columns in the footer into the arrangements that I'd like, however after struggling for a bit I was unable to figure out how to remove the text from the social media icons, leaving only the hyperlink icons. I'm a minimalist by design, so the less text and more visual interpretation on a page the better.

I've also tried to adjust the title of the blog a few times, but seem unsuccessful in publishing a new title no matter how many times I edit the _config.yml file. Might just be the result of a lack of sleep and too many hours staring at iTerm, but tomorrow morning warrants another crack at it.

And finally, before I find some classy banner or switch to a side nav bar with a logo of sorts - here is Gohan. Because, Gohan.
